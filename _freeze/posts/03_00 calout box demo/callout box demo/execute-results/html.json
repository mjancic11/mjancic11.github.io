I found an easy solution, simply adding `scipen = 999` to the first R code chunk. However, in the process of searching came across a nice visual display of a summary at the top of a [blog post](https://graphdr.github.io/data-stories/posts/2022-11-18-formatdown/). I really liked this type of highlighting some of the text and explored straight away, how to implement it in my [teaching materials](https://maticjancic.github.io/posts/03_GLOBAL%20ENV%20DATA.html). The form itself is called a **call-out box** and the following five types are very easy to implement:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\nTo create either one of them, one needs to add the following syntax within the RMarkdown or Quarto document. To define the different type of the call-out box, the part within the curly brackets needs to be replaced with one of the `note, warning, important, tip, or caution`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n::: {.callout-caution}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n```\n:::\n\n\nOther words can be used as well to create a custom named call-out box. In that case however, the box is colored in grey by default and there is no icon preceding the box name:\n\n::: {.callout-disclaimer}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\nIt is of course possible, to change the color of the call-out boxes, their names and to retain the symbols, but I'm not there yet üòÇ. I will leave you with an example of that (**all credits go to the [slide authors](https://emitanaka.org/), which are a huge inspiration to me**) and conclude that I just got a new idea for a blog post üòÑüòéüí™:\n \n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cwd.numbat.space/lectures/lecture-01.html#/week-1-lesson-1\" title=\"Emi Tanaka\"></iframe>\n```",

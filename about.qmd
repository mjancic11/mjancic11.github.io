This is me. I like being outdoors - hiking, biking, running, climbing (sometimes more, sometimes less). I also tried alpine climbing and ultra trail running. I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.

This is also me. I'm grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I'm disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.

If you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4 AM), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.   

And I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being .. just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:

* Marine Ecology,
* Marine Conservation Biology,
* Ecology of terrestrial ecosystems,
* Advanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),
* Biology and conservation of large vertebrates,
* Marine protected areas - human dimensions,
* Population biology,
* Conservation ecology of marine mammals.

Uf, ...  and at bachelor level:

* Basics of using R as GIS,
* Introductory zoology,
* Biology and diversity of vertebrates.

Though I'm a "trained" biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but also like to prepare learning materials with markdown. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and so many associated tools make it super easy to so much, especially for people that are not programmers per se.

I will finish about me section with my education. You may not know, but I've studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:

* PhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)
* Msc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)
* BSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)

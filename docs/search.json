I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.\nThis is also me. I‚Äôm grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I‚Äôm disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.\nIf you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4h), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.\nAnd I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being ‚Ä¶ Just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:\n\nMarine Ecology,\nMarine Conservation Biology,\nEcology of terrestrial ecosystems,\nAdvanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),\nBiology and conservation of large vertebrates,\nMarine protected areas - human dimensions,\nPopulation biology,\nConservation ecology of marine mammals.\n\nUf, ‚Ä¶ and at bachelor level:\n\nBasics of using R as GIS (materials),\nIntroductory zoology,\nBiology and diversity of vertebrates.\n\nThough I‚Äôm a ‚Äútrained‚Äù biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self-taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but I also like to prepare learning materials with markdown and now transitioning to quarto. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and associated tools make it super easy to do so many things, especially for people that are not programmers per se.\nI will finish the About me section with education. You may not know, but I‚Äôve studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:\n\nPhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\nMSc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)\nBSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)"

They are stored in a bib document and cited according to Frontiers in marine science template. As it is a common practice to highlight your name, I found a very simple solution online (thank you Neil Wright for that) and used two lua scripts (never heard before that lua exists) to do just that. My name is now automatically written with bold letters. Hurray!!\nI will conclude here with the welcome post and go figuring out, how to get this blog online.

    "text": "Why did I need (want) to escape the UNI?\nIn the About pages I briefly wrote about my duties as a teaching assistant working at a Slovenian University. Even though my career is still in the beginning phases (its my 7th year), I already contemplated multiple times to quit and change my profession. I started out as a so called research assistant on a sea turtle conservation oriented project, called LIFE Euroturtles in December 2016. This was my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù job, longer term and related to my field of studies. I landed the job roughly half a year after I spent 10 months on an internship at Blue World Institute (Lo≈°inj island, Croatia) and I really looked forward to it. My job duties on paper included field work related to sea-turtle-fisheries interaction, tourists perception and valuation of turtles and drone surveys in Slovenian sea. After a while I took over roughly the same work duties on Euroturtles project in the cross border region in Croatia (Umag & Savudrija). Along with that, other obligations kept pilling on. First I was ‚Äúasked‚Äù to help with organisation of an international marine conservation summer school & Mediterranean Conference on Marine Turtles both in 2018. All the time, teaching obligations has been increasing, mostly in the study year 2019-20, after a colleague resigned and I was handed over everything that he was covering. On top of all that, I also had to enroll in the PhD to keep my job and the Covid hit us in early 2020.\nFast forward a couple of years, I grew sick and tired of my job obligations transforming from research only to teaching only. Last year (2021/22) I taught 8 courses on master level and 1 on bachelor, and that accounted for, believe it or not, 70% of full working time (40h/week). And I had enough, it was to much, I had no time to work on my PhD, nor the energy or motivation to do it outside of working hours. I told my bosses I‚Äôm dropping some of the courses for this year (2022/23), knowing and accepting the reduced paycheck that could come with that. I decided to go away from the UNI for one semester, agreed with colleagues at Blue World Institute and applied for Erasmus scholarship. The scholarship would mostly cover my expenses while on Lo≈°inj so I wouldn‚Äôt have to many financial worries in case of reduced paycheck. To my surprise, the dean of the faculty offered me a full time contract for one year, for which I am very grateful to him! I accepted and signed the contract, got my Erasmus scholarship and ‚Ä¶"

    "text": "What will I be doing on Lo≈°inj?\nI came to Lo≈°inj with one big priority, that is the preparation of the second paper for my PhD (telemetry of juvenile loggerheads in Adriatic Sea, more to come üòé). The field work was done almost 10 years ago, when I was still in my master, some of it during my first stint at BWI (I had not been a part of the team back than). In the past couple of years I worked a bit on this data and attended a very good online course on analysing telemetry data at Smithosonian Mason School of Conservation (back than a mix of this and this). In the last three weeks while here on Lo≈°inj, I already (re)started working on telemetry data, by going over materials that I prepared for thesis proposal, added new information to it and presented it to other intern students at BWI. I was very happy when I found a paper that applied the exact same method I was contemplating on very similar data with a very similar aim. I found a roadmap on how to proceed and I‚Äôm way ahead of my self imposed schedule üí™.\nThere are some other cool things I/we will do while I will be here:\n\nwith Tina (BWI veterinarian) I will be occasionally taking care of turtles in rehabilitation center.\n\n\n\nwith Mateja (BWI turtle researcher) we already prepared a plan to inspect beaches of Lo≈°inj and islands in vicinity if there are some that are potentially suitable for nesting. Thanks to Alan Rees we are ahead of schedule with that too üí™! We aim to publish the results of this survey in MedTurtleBulletin.\n\n\n\nwith Tina, Mateja and Willem (visiting student) we will write a short communication on post-hatchling observations in Croatian Adriatic and try to figure out why more are being observed in recent years (more to come üòé).\n\n\n\nBut apart from the working, I really look forward to experiencing the island itself and enjoy some time with people around here. The fellow interns are great, some colleagues from the 2015 still around, some unfortunately too far away. I am missing and will miss my girlfriend, my brother and my friends, but they will all likely visit me here and we will have a great time together as well! If I leave the island in August with half the enthusiasm that I had 8 years ago, it will be well worth it to escape from the UNI. I will leave you with some glimpses of the beautiful island of Lo≈°inj (note that there is no dolphin photo, which otherwise is a trademark of the island)."

    "text": "How I was writing my first paper\nThese two photos were the starting point for writing my first scientific paper, back at the end of 2019. The idea was first to just publish these two new records, which were accompanied by several more from our Italian and Croatian colleagues. We also found one record in Albania supported by a good quality photo on GBIF, which came as a nice surprise. So I prepared something that resembled a manuscript, sent it to my supervisor and ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt hear from him for the next 12 months.\nAfter that time, I got back to the manuscript, searched the web and found a bunch of reports, which included information on sightings of the green sea turtle in the Adriatic Sea. After some discussion, this changed the narrative of the article and we refocused the paper not just on new sightings, but why there seem to be many more sightings since the year 2000, compared to the period before. We now had 8 new, unreported sightings, and roughly 65 reported. This also enabled us to analyse the sizes and temporal distribution of animals that were observed in the Adriatic Sea. For the sake of the publication, the plots were done in a more traditional, standard, black and white (code at the end with all the ‚Äúpolishing details‚Äù). My friend Manja drew a very nice sketch of the green turtle head that we added to the empty space of the plot (you can find more of her art here). For this post, I decided to use a simply plotly histogram in which I only changed the color of the bars to match the header of my webpage:\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ngreens &lt;- read.csv(\"green_length_adr.csv\") %&gt;% drop_na(CCL)\n\n# Plotly histogram\ngreens %&gt;% \n  plotly::plot_ly(data = .,\n                  x = ~CCL,\n                  type = \"histogram\",\n                  marker = list(color = \"#2C3E50\")) %&gt;% \n  plotly::layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Curved carapace length (cm)'),\n                 yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency'))"

    "text": "What did we figure out in this study?\nBased on the data we had acquired and analysed it seems that the number of green sea turtle observations in the Adriatic Sea increased more than tenfold between 2000 - 2020, and will likely continue to increase. We attributed this intriguing increase to:\n\nthe increase of the Mediterranean green sea turtle population,\nthe increased capacity of institutes, universities and NGOs around the Adriatic, resulting in higher awareness of sea turtles in the region and lastly,\nclimate change - warming seas seem to be shifting the Adriatic to be more favourable for green turtles (and they can find many areas with food sources they need).\n\nTwo most notable areas where green turtles were most commonly observed were coasts of Albania and southern Italy. Again, there is a more traditional map in the paper, but below you can find the same data visualized using leaflet. You will note that there are two big red circles (recent observations) with the same label in Drini Bay - they simply represent the data divided in two smaller compartments (2003 - 2010 and 2011 - 2018).\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\ngreen_locs &lt;- read.csv(\"green_locs_adr.csv\", sep = \";\",\n                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\npal &lt;- colorFactor(palette = c(\"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n                   domain = green_locs$Period)\n\nleaflet(green_locs) %&gt;% \n    addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;% \n    addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ X,\n                     lat = ~ Y,\n                     radius = 4 * sqrt(green_locs$N),\n                     stroke = FALSE,\n                     fillOpacity = 0.7,\n                     color = ~pal(Period),\n                     label = green_locs$Location) %&gt;%\n    addLegend(pal = pal,\n              values = ~Period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe finally managed to publish this article in December 2022. From a relatively easy thing, to publish a couple of new observations of a rare species, this paper turned out to be a quite big review of what we know about green sea turtles in the Adriatic. For me, it was also a steep learning curve on scientific writing. When I look in the folder with my ‚Äúversion controlled‚Äù manuscripts (there are at least 30), I started as a complete rookie and now feel way better equipped to tackle my three paper PhD dissertation. For those interested in more information about our paper, you can find it and download it here."

    "text": "How can you access species occurence data and what is in it?\nTo access the occurrence data we can use occ_search() function, which will contact the GBIF server and download the data from the database. For example, if you are interested in occurences of the fin whale, you would have to set the argument scientificName = \"Balaenoptera physalus\". There are many helpful arguments we could use to refine our search (i.e.¬†hasCoordinate, country, continent, etc.), but I will refrain from using them in this post. This will download the data and store in the gbif format, which is essentially a list with 5 elements. We could explore all of them, but we are mostly interested in the $data part, where coordinates and other information on the records are stored. You can explore the resulting data set in the table below the photo.\n\n\n\nFin whale (photo credit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/slobirdr/29414853626)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(rgbif)\nphysalus_gbif &lt;- occ_search(scientificName = \"Balaenoptera physalus\")\n\nphysalus &lt;- physalus_gbif$data \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have noted there were 500 observations included in the table (number of entries). This happens by default, if there are more than 500 occurrences in the database, as is the case for fin whales (there are 110079 occurrences; which i found out with occ_count(taxonKey = 2440718)). To access more (or less), we would need to change the parameter limit = to the desired value (100,000 is the hard maximum stated in the package vignette). Lastly, look on the map where whales from our sample were seen. Whale icons created by Good Ware - Flaticon.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(png)\n\nwhale &lt;- makeIcon(iconUrl = \"https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2834/2834539.png\",\n                   iconWidth = 25, iconHeight = 25)\n\nleaflet(physalus) %&gt;%\n    addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;%\n    addMarkers(\n        lng = ~ decimalLongitude,\n        lat = ~ decimalLatitude,\n        icon = whale,\n        label = ~ country\n    )"

    "text": "How can you access taxa occurrences for a limited geographic region?\nThe following example is a result of GBIF inspection after one student expressed the interest to graduate on nudibranchs (marine snails that lack shells) and do something with R (I was proud, that not all students go home in tears after my R labs üòÑ). First, just google nudibranchs and be amazed in what colors and shapes they come. I am showing just one that I find very interesting.\n\n\n\nPilgrim hervia Cratena peregrina (photo credit: https://commons.wikimedia.org/)\n\n\nSo, before agreeing with this student on what she could do for her bachelor thesis, I quickly looked at what is available on GBIF for our region. I found out occ_search() can be used for higher taxa as well, but not by their Latin names. One needs to first find out the key of the taxa of interest (be it phylum, kingdom, class, order, familiy or genus) using name_suggest(q = \"Taxa of interest\") function. The function returns all keys that match the search string, see example below for Nudibranchia.\nTo access the Nudibranch data, we now need to specify orderKey = 980. To limited the search to Adriatic Sea we can use geometry = 'POLYGON(()) argument which is very simple. I searched for multiple coordinates on Google-maps to create a polygon around the Adriatic Sea and list them within the parenthesis. The thing to be aware of is that the polygon has to be closed, i.e.¬†the first and last point must have the same coordinates.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(rgbif)\n\nnudibranch_Adriatic_gbif &lt;- \n  occ_search(geometry = 'POLYGON((18.46 40.05, 22.03 42.26, 13.89 46.87, 8.68 46.36, 18.46 40.05))',\n             orderKey = 980,\n             limit = 5000)\n\nnudibranch_Adriatic &lt;- nudibranch_Adriatic_gbif$data\n\nname_suggest(q = \"Nudibranchia\")\n\n\nRecords returned [3] \nNo. unique hierarchies [0] \nArgs [q=Nudibranchia, limit=100, fields1=key, fields2=canonicalName,\n     fields3=rank] \n# A tibble: 3 √ó 3\n      key canonicalName              rank   \n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     980 Nudibranchia               ORDER  \n2 4329412 Thysanote nudibranchiata   SPECIES\n3 8310904 Auricularia nudibranchiata SPECIES\n\n\n\nWhen the data is downloaded, we again extract only $data part, where coordinates are stored. This inquiry yielded 547 occurrences that belong to 52 different species (list at the end of the post). You can see where they were recorded on the map below. Nudibranch icon accessed at MahaRaja Eco Dive Lodge.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nnudibranch &lt;-\n    makeIcon(iconUrl = \"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a55df2e9f8dce980ddb50ea/1515818936193-QIFQGV59CKSO9ZFX4GAD/Icon-09.png?format=750w\",\n             iconWidth = 25,\n             iconHeight = 25)\n\nleaflet(nudibranch_Adriatic) %&gt;% \n     addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;% \n     addMarkers(lat = ~decimalLatitude,\n                      lng = ~decimalLongitude,\n                      label = ~species,\n                      icon = nudibranch)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI find it fascinating and amazing what happens when people join forces and do things for common good. The GBIF is an example of just that. The data is contributed to GBIF from around 2400 different sources, that include citizen science databases (i.e.¬†iNaturalist), Universities, Institutes, Museums, etc. And to everyone else, including you and me, it is freely available to see, navigate, use and reuse! Kudos!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAn in depth description of GBIF data access and analysis can be found here."

    "text": "When preparing teaching materials for my visit to University of Pula, Croatia, I needed to solve the default printing of numbers from R code to scientific format. I found an easy solution, simply adding scipen = 999 to the first R code chunk. However, in the process of searching I came across a nice visual display of a summary at the top of a blog post. I really liked this type of highlighting some of the text and explored straight away, how to implement it in my teaching materials. The form itself is called a call-out box and the following five types are very easy to implement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\nTo create either one of them, one needs to add the following syntax within the RMarkdown or Quarto document. To define the different type of the call-out box, the part within the curly brackets needs to be replaced with one of the note, warning, important, tip, or caution:\n\n\nShow the code\n::: {.callout-caution}\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including:\n`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n\nOther words can be used as well to create a custom named call-out box. In that case however, the box is colored in grey by default and there is no icon preceding the box name:\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\nIt is of course possible, to change the color of the call-out boxes, their names and to retain the symbols, but I‚Äôm not there yet üòÇ. I will leave you with an example of that (all credits go to the slide authors, which are a huge inspiration to me) and conclude that I just got a new idea for a blog post üòÑüòéüí™:"

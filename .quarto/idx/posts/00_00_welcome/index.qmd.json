{"title":"Welcome To My Blog","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Welcome To My Blog","author":"MJ","date":"2023-02-1","categories":["news"]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nThis is my first post using Quarto. Welcome!\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\nSince this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.\n\n---\n\nHahaha. I'll just leave the above in the post, so you all know it. Quarto will use the first image in the post as the one to show in the listing page. \n\nAt this point in time, I'm starting this blog with multiple objectives:\n\n* learn how to use quarto and use it instead of RMarkdown (I intend to remake all my teaching materials using quarto and publish online),\n* get in the habit of writing more, specifically writing non-academic stuff,\n* hopefully advertise myself, as I'm not sure, whether or how long I'm staying in academia,\n* maybe something else, but can't elaborate now.\n\nAs I'm writing these lines, I don't yet know how to publish this blog online. I will try to do it using github pages, but still need to figure it out how.\n\nWhat I find extremely fascinating, is how easy it is (so far) to create and adapt the pages of the website. As you will see, I added the page `Publications` at the top right corner of the page, where you can find the scientific papers that I was a (co)author of. They are stored in a `bib` document and cited according to `Frontiers in marine science template`. As it is a common practice to highlight your name, I found a very simple solution [online](https://www.neilwright.uk/posts/quarto-bibliography-format-name.html) (thank you Neil Wright for that) and used two `lua` scripts (never heard before that `lua` exists) to do just that. My name is now automatically written with bold letters. Hurray!!\n\nI will conclude here with the welcome post and go figuring out, how to get this blog online. If I make it, you will be able to read this lines. If not, well, for now, you are not missing out a lot.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","theme":"Flatly","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Welcome To My Blog","author":"MJ","date":"2023-02-1","categories":["news"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

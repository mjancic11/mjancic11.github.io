Code is written and saved. In a year it will (most likely) still work. Also our peers/reviewers can check which analysis and how it was performed to reproduce our results (**basis of science!**)\n* is highly extensible. Development of new tools/functions is relatively simple, new functionalities are being developed and uploaded daily to  [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)(statistics, biology, ecology, modelling and similar) & [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)(genetic, pharmaceuticals and all *omics* fields)!\n* has a very lively community, its easy to find answers for all problems (**just google it** - *how to ...*, *error xyz in r*) or on dedicated web communities ([stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/)).\n\nAccording to many, R is one of the easiest programming languages to learn and use *in the long run*, but **might be very challenging at the beginning**. [You are among the lucky ones, that were granted a great teacher to gently introduce you to it.]{.underline} üòâ\n\n---\n\nBase R is a console in which text or numbers (or both) are typed. It expects meaningful inputs that it can execute. Otherwise it will return an error. We will not be using base R directly, but as a part of RStudio.\n\n![Base R console.](05_images/Rconsole.PNG)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRStudio is a sophisticated working environment that usually has four open panes: \n\n* One pane is R console, which represents an integration of R language within the program. Here all commands will be executed.\n* One pane is an R script, which is simple text editor, where we will write our commands and save them for further use (*The script might not be open at the start of RStudio*).\n* One pane combines multiple tabs (`Files`, `Plots`, `Packages`, `Help` & `Viewer`) which we will look at later when working on examples.  \n* One pane combines multiple tabs (`Environment`, `History` & `Connections`). At this point, `Environment` is the only one important to us: it **is the \"place\" where the data we will work with has to be available**. You can see in the image below, that the environment is empty (*and it should be empty in your computers as well, if you haven't done anything after the installation*).\n\n\n::: {.callout-task}\nOpen R studio. The interface should look like in the image below (the order of the panes might be different, which is OK). \n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Rstudio interface.](05_images/Rstudio.png)\n\n::: {.callout-task}\nOpen an empty R script from the `File`{.R} dropdown menu by clicking `New file \\ R script`{.R}.

This denotes a comment in the R script and the console knows, that it is not a part of the code and should be ignored.\n\nComments are very useful as we have a tendency to forget. They kindly remind us, what we did with different parts of the code, when we return to it a year later. \n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next thing that you need to know are logical operators. At this point, we will just try them out, in the next labs you will see their importance in filtering and selecting specific parts of your data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Operator   |Description              |\n|:----------|:------------------------|\n|<          |Less than                |\n|<=         |Less than or equal to    |\n|>          |Greater than             |\n|>=         |Greater than or equal to |\n|==         |Exactly equal to         |\n|!=         |Not equal to             |\n|x &#124; y |Or (Alt GR & w)          |\n|x & y      |And                      |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLets use them in practice. \n\n::: {.callout-task}\nCopy and paste below calculations in the R script, move cursor to the first row with code and click `Run`{.R}.

For this, assign operator `<-`{.R} is used. The value on the right side of it will be assigned to a name on the left. **The name is choosen by us and it can be (almost) anything**. When we use the assign operator the result of the code will not be displayed in the console, but a name should appear in R working environment. \n\n\n::: {.callout-task}\nCopy and paste below code in the R script, move cursor to the first row with code and click `Run`{.R}.

Instead of typing the whole command, you can select an option from the suggested list.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-task}\n[Type ten random names into the script and assign each a number or a result of a calculation]{.underline} (as example above). Start clicking `Run`{.R} in the first typed row and move down with the cursor to each row.

Start clicking `Run`{.R} in the first row and move down with the cursor to each row containing a name. The result should be ten printed names in the console with their corresponding values below.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\n* What are some of the most basic functionalities R can be used for?\n* What is an R object and where does it get a name from?\n* How can we inspect / see what an R object contains?\n\nDo you have any questions?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Data types: vectors, dataframes and lists \n\nThere are many data types defined within R. Among the basic types, vectors, data frames and lists are the most important. By assigning values to objects above, you have already created a vector. This vectors contain only one element - the number that you have assigned to a specific name. \n\nVectors by definition contain only elements of the same data type, which can be:\n\n-   Numeric (numbers),\n-   Logical (TRUE, FALSE),\n-   Character strings (letters or words, of which each must be included within `\" \"` for R to know its a word not a name of an object),\n-   Integers (whole numbers, important for programmers, not so much for us),\n-   Missing data or Not Available data (coded as `NA` and the only type that can be included in vectors of other types).\n\nWe create vectors by using function `c()`{.R} and typing the values of the vector within the parenthesis separated by commas (`,`).  \n\n::: {.callout-task}\nCopy and paste below code in the R script, move cursor to the first row with code and click `Run`{.R}. Move cursor to each row that contains code and repeat. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumerical_vector <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)\n\nlogical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\ncharacter_vector <- c(\"R\", \"is\", \"a\", \"wonderful\", \"tool\")\n\nmixed_vector <- c(\"R\", NA, 1, TRUE, 7.9631423)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf a vector contains elements that belong to different types, it will coerce the entire vector to the lowest common type. An example is the `mixed_vector`, for which you will see shortly that all elements were converted to `characters`.\n:::\n\nThere are two properties of vectors that are of interest. The first is the number of elements that a vector contains and can be checked by using `length()`{.R} function and the name of the vector within its parenthesis. The second is the type of the vector that can be checked by using `class()`{.R} and the name of the vector within its parenthesis. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsquare_root_of_9 ; length(square_root_of_9) ; class(square_root_of_9)  # number \n\n# three numbers and one not available\nnumerical_vector ; length(numerical_vector) ; class(numerical_vector) \n\n# four logical values\nlogical_vector ; length(logical_vector) ; class(logical_vector)\n \n# five words -> note that also displayed in console, the elements are in \" \"\ncharacter_vector ; length(character_vector) ; class(character_vector)\n\n# 4 elements, three coerced to characters by R automatically putting \" \" around all \n# values of the vector\nmixed_vector ; length(mixed_vector) ; class(mixed_vector)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA data frame in its essence are multiple vectors combined in a table. Each vector we add to the table becomes one column of this table. Data frames are the most common and most used data type. Usually, data frames are imported from our computer hard-drive, but we will also take a look at how to manually create one. \n\nLike vectors, data frames have their own properties as well. We can check how many rows (`nrow()`{.R}) or columns a data frame has (`ncol()`{.R}), or simply check the dimensions of a data frame (`dim()`{.R}). We can also extract or change the names of the columns of our data frame with `names()`{.R} function. summary ... print by typing and running its name ..\n\n::: {.callout-task}\nCopy and paste below code in the R script, move cursor to the first row with code and click `Run`{.R}.

Move cursor to each row that contains code and repeat. \n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_list <- list(1,\n                     \"Pula, Croatia\",\n                     mixed_vector,\n                     example_data_frame,\n                     list(1,\n                          \"Pula, Croatia\",\n                          mixed_vector,\n                          example_data_frame))\n\nexample_list\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Pula, Croatia\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"R\"         NA          \"1\"         \"TRUE\"      \"7.9631423\"\n\n[[4]]\n  numerical_vector logical_vector character_vector mixed_vector\n1                1           TRUE                R            R\n2                2           TRUE               is         <NA>\n3               NA          FALSE                a            1\n4                4          FALSE        wonderful         TRUE\n5                5           TRUE             tool    7.9631423\n\n[[5]]\n[[5]][[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[5]][[2]]\n[1] \"Pula, Croatia\"\n\n[[5]][[3]]\n[1] \"R\"         NA          \"1\"         \"TRUE\"      \"7.9631423\"\n\n[[5]][[4]]\n  numerical_vector logical_vector character_vector mixed_vector\n1                1           TRUE                R            R\n2                2           TRUE               is         <NA>\n3               NA          FALSE                a            1\n4                4          FALSE        wonderful         TRUE\n5                5           TRUE             tool    7.9631423\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-task}\nSave the R script to the desktop of your computer. \n\nWhen you close R studio, select `Yes` when it asks if you want to save your work-space.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\n* What defines an R vector and which basic vector types there are?\n* How are R vectors and R dataframes connected?\n* What are some functions that allow us to explore the properties of vectors and dataframes in terms of number of elements, rows columns etc.?\n* What are R lists?\n\nDo you have any questions?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n### Take home message\n\nR is a language and learning it is similar to learning a foreign language. It takes time and patience. The good thing is that there are only two really important thing to grasp at the beginning: what is an object and a function, and how these two interact: a function (*usualy predefined by R developers*) is applied to an object (*which has a given name, usualy by us*) and we expect something to happen as a result. Note that you used several function on several objects today (i.e. functions `c()`{.R}, `data.frame()`{.R}, `names()`{.R} etc., on objects `character_vector`{.R}, `heigth`{.R}, `best_class_ever`{.R} etc.). This is the essence of working with R and most of the time you will be doing just that, `function(object)`{.R} and get what you wanted or get: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunction(object)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: <text>:2:0: unexpected end of input\n1: function(object)\n   ^\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n![Partly funded by EU Erasmus+ Programme for Higher Education Staff Mobility.](05_images/EU Erasmuslogo.jpg)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPartly funded by EU Erasmus+ Programme for Higher Education Staff Mobility\n\n<br>",

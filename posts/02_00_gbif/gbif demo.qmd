## What is [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and why is it fascinating?

**GBIF** is an abbreviation for **Global Biodiversity Information Facility**, an international network and data infrastructure. It is funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, **open access** to data about all types of life on Earth. 

At the time of writing, there were **more than 2.7 billion records** published in the GBIF database, in both marine and terrestrial realm on a global scale. The webpage itself is very practical in terms of navigation and search, but what is even better is that occurence data can be easily accessed and downloaded through R (`rgbif`{.R} package), either for a species or taxa of interest. Lets take a look on how it can done.

## How can you access species occurence data and what is in it?

To access the occurrence data we can use `occ_search()`{.R} function, which will contact the GBIF server and download the data from the database. For example, if you are interested in occurences of The fin whale, you would have to set the argument `scientificName = "Balaenoptera physalus"`{.R}. There are many helpful arguments, that we could use, to refine our search (i.e. `hasCoordinate`, `country`, `continent`, etc.), but I will refrain from using them in this post. This will download the data and store in an `gbif` format, which is essentially a list with 5 elements. We could explore all of them, but we are mostly interested in the `$data` part, where coordinates and other information on the records are stored. You can explore the resulting data set in the table below the photo.

```{r}
library(rgbif)
physalus_gbif <- occ_search(scientificName = "Balaenoptera physalus")

physalus <- physalus_gbif$data 


```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(physalus,
              filter = 'top',
              options = list(pageLength = 4))
```

You might have noted there were 500 observations included in the table (number of entries). This happens by default, if there are more than 500 occurrences in the database, as is the case for fin whales (there are `r occ_count(taxonKey = 2440718)` occurrences; which i found out with `occ_count(taxonKey = 2440718)`). To access more (or less), we would need to change the paramater `limit =` to the desired value (*100,000 is the hard maximum stated in the package vignette*). Lastly, look on the map where whales from our sample were seen. Whale icons created by Good Ware - [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/whale).

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(png)

whale <- makeIcon(iconUrl = "https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2834/2834539.png",
                   iconWidth = 25, iconHeight = 25)

leaflet(physalus) %>%
    addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>%
    addMarkers(
        lng = ~ decimalLongitude,
        lat = ~ decimalLatitude,
        icon = whale,
        label = ~ country
    )
```


## How can you access taxa occurrences for a limited geographic region? 

The following example is a result of GBIF inspection after one student expresed desire to graduate on [nudibranchs](https://biologydictionary.net/nudibranch/) (marine snails that lack shells) and **do something with R** (I was proud, that not all students go home in tears after my R labs `r emo::ji("smile")`). First, just google nudibranchs and be amazed in what colors and shapes they come. I am showing just one that I find very interesting.

So, before agreeing with this student, what she could do for her bachelor thesis, I quickly looked at what is available on GBIF for our region. I found out `occ_search()` can be used for higher taxa as well, **but not by their Latin names**. One need to first find out the key of the taxa of interest (be it phylum, kingdom, class, order, familiy or genus) using `name_suggest(q = "Taxa of interest")` function. The function returns all keys that match the search string, see example below for Nudibranchia. 

To access the Nudibranch data, we now need to specify `orderKey = 980`. To limited the search to Adriatic sea we can use `geometry = 'POLYGON(())` argument which is very simple. I searched for multiple coordinates on Google-maps to create a polygon around the Adriatic sea and list them within the parenthesis. The thing to be aware of is that the polygon has to be closed, i.e. the first and last point must have the same coordinates. 


```{r}
library(rgbif)

nudibranch_Adriatic_gbif <- 
  occ_search(geometry = 'POLYGON((18.46 40.05, 22.03 42.26, 13.89 46.87, 8.68 46.36, 18.46 40.05))',
             orderKey = 980,
             limit = 5000)

nudibranch_Adriatic <- nudibranch_Adriatic_gbif$data

name_suggest(q = "Nudibranchia")

```

---

When the data is downloaded, we again extract only `$data` part, where coordinates are stored. This inquiry yielded `r nrow(nudibranch_Adriatic)` occurences that belong to `r length(unique(nudibranch_Adriatic$species)) - 1` different species (A list at the end of the post). You can see where they were recorded on the map below. Nudibranch icon accessed at [MahaRaja Eco Dive Lodge](https://www.maharajaecodivelodge.com/gallery-icons/).


```{r, out.width = "100%"}
library(leaflet)

nudibranch <-
    makeIcon(iconUrl = "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a55df2e9f8dce980ddb50ea/1515818936193-QIFQGV59CKSO9ZFX4GAD/Icon-09.png?format=750w",
             iconWidth = 25,
             iconHeight = 25)

leaflet(nudibranch_Adriatic) %>% 
     addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>% 
     addMarkers(lat = ~decimalLatitude,
                      lng = ~decimalLongitude,
                      label = ~species,
                      icon = nudibranch)


```

I find it fascinating and amazing what happens when people join forces and do things for common good. The GBIF is an example of just that. The data is contributed to GBIF from around 2400 different sources, that include citizen science databases (i.e. [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)), Universities, Institutes, Museums, etc. And to everyone else, including you and me, it is freely available to see, navigate, use and reuse! Kudos!

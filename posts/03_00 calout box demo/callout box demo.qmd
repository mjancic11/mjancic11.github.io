When preparing teaching materials for my visit to University of Pula, Croatia, I needed to solve the default printing of numbers from R code to scientific format. I found an easy solution, simply adding `scipen = 999` to the first R code chunk. However, in the process of searching I came across a nice visual display of a summary at the top of a [blog post](https://graphdr.github.io/data-stories/posts/2022-11-18-formatdown/). I really liked this type of highlighting some of the text and explored straight away, how to implement it in my [teaching materials](https://maticjancic.github.io/posts/03_GLOBAL%20ENV%20DATA.html). The form itself is called a **call-out box** and the following five types are very easy to implement:

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

To create either one of them, one needs to add the following syntax within the RMarkdown or Quarto document. To define the different type of the call-out box, the part within the curly brackets needs to be replaced with one of the `note, warning, important, tip, or caution`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
::: {.callout-caution}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

```

Other words can be used as well to create a custom named call-out box. In that case however, the box is colored in grey by default and there is no icon preceding the box name:

::: {.callout-disclaimer}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

It is of course possible, to change the color of the call-out boxes, their names and to retain the symbols, but I'm not there yet `r emo::ji("face with tears of joy")`. I will leave you with an example of that (**all credits go to the [slide authors](https://emitanaka.org/), which are a huge inspiration to me**) and conclude that I just got a new idea for a blog post `r emo::ji("smile")``r emo::ji("sunglasses")``r emo::ji("biceps")`:

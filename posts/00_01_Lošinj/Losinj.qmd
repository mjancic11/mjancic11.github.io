## Why did I need (want) to escape the UNI?

In the [About](https://maticjancic.github.io/about.html) pages I briefly wrote about my duties as a teaching assistant working at a Slovenian University. Even though my career is still in the beginning phases (its my 7th year), I already contemplated multiple times to quit and change my profession. I started out as a so called research assistant on a sea turtle conservation oriented project, called [LIFE Euroturtles](https://www.euroturtles.eu/) in December 2016. This was my first "real" job, longer term and related to my field of studies. I landed the job roughly half a year after I spent 10 months on an internship at [Blue World Institute](https://www.blue-world.org/) (Lošinj island, Croatia) and I really looked forward to it. My job duties on paper included field work related to sea-turtle-fisheries interaction, tourists perception and valuation of turtles and drone surveys in Slovenian sea. After a while I took over roughly the same work duties on Euroturtles project in the cross border region in Croatia (Umag & Savudrija). Along with that, other obligations kept pilling on. First I was "asked" to help with organisation of an [international marine conservation summer school](https://ismcs.famnit.upr.si/en/) & [Mediterranean Conference on Marine Turtles](https://marine-turtles.eu/) both in 2018. All the time, teaching obligations has been increasing, mostly in the study year 2019-20, after a colleague resigned and I was handed over everything that he was covering. On top of all that, I also had to enroll in the PhD to keep my job and the Covid hit us in early 2020.    

Fast forward a couple of years, I grew sick and tired of my job obligations transforming from research only to teaching only. Last year (2021/22) I taught **8 courses on master level and 1 on bachelor**, and that accounted for, believe it or not, **70% of full working time (40h/week)**. And I had enough, it was to much, I had no time to work on my PhD, nor the energy or motivation to do it outside of working hours. I told my bosses I'm dropping some of the courses for this year (2022/23), knowing and accepting the reduced paycheck that could come with that. I decided to go away from the UNI for one semester, agreed with colleagues at Blue World Institute and applied for Erasmus scholarship. The scholarship would mostly cover my expenses while on Lošinj so I wouldn't have to many financial worries in case of reduced paycheck. To my surprise, the dean of the faculty offered me a full time contract for one year, for which I am very grateful to him! I accepted and signed the contract, got my Erasmus scholarship and ...

## What will I be doing on Lošinj?

I came to Lošinj with one big priority, that is the preparation of the second paper for my PhD (telemetry of juvenile loggerheads in Adriatic Sea, more to come `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`). The field work was done almost 10 years ago, when I was still in my master, some of it during my first stint at BWI (I had not been a part of the team back than). In the past couple of years I worked a bit on this data and attended a very good online course on analysing telemetry data at Smithosonian Mason School of Conservation (back than a mix of [this](https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/graduate-and-professional/gis-ol/) and [this](https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/graduate-and-professional/glm_ecology-ol/)). In the last three weeks while here on Lošinj, I already (re)started working on telemetry data, by going over materials that I prepared for thesis proposal, added new information to it and presented it to other intern students at BWI. I was very happy when I found a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.924532/full) that applied the exact same method I was contemplating on very similar data with a very similar aim. I found a roadmap on how to proceed and I'm way ahead of my self imposed schedule `r emo::ji("biceps")`.

There are some other cool things I/we will do while I will be here: 

* with Tina (BWI veterinarian) I will be occasionally taking care of turtles in rehabilitation center.

* with Mateja (BWI turtle researcher) we already prepared a plan to inspect beaches of Lošinj and islands in vicinity if there are some that are potentially suitable for nesting. Thanks to [Alan Rees](https://alanrees.my-free.website) we are ahead of schedule with that too `r emo::ji("biceps")`! We aim to publish the results of this survey in [MedTurtleBulletin](https://alanrees.my-free.website/medturtlebulletin).

* with Tina, Mateja and Willem (visiting student) we will write a short communication on post-hatchling observations in Croatian Adriatic and try to figure out why more are being observed in recent years (more to come `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`).

***

But apart from the working, I really look forward to experiencing the island itself and enjoy some time with people around here. The fellow interns are great, some colleagues from the 2015 still around, some unfortunately too far away. I am missing and will miss my girlfriend, my brother and my friends, but they will all likely visit me here and we will have a great time together as well! If I leave the island in August with half the enthusiasm that I had 8 years ago, it will be well worth it to escape from the UNI. I will leave you with some glimpses of the beautiful island of Lošinj (note that there is no dolphin photo, which otherwise is a trademark of the island).

## How we got the records of the rare species

So, if you read the [About](https://maticjancic.github.io/about.html) pages, you might already know that I was working on board of fishing vessels for three summer seasons. And with many fisherman, the after work-routine is to have a drink when you're done. Once, I was sitting with one of them, when he started to explain, that one of the sea turtles he caught was very different from others. He looked for the photo on his phone and it was obvious that we're not talking about the loggerhead sea turtle *Caretta caretta*, which is a common species in the area, but rather about the green sea turtle *Chelonia mydas* (left on the photo), which is rarely seen in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The second record came a couple of months later, when I got a call from another fisherman at 5:30. He told me there was a weird turtle with a completely white plastron (belly, underside) in his nets and sent me a couple of photos (fourth in the photo, in the hand of the fisherman).

## How I was writing my first paper

These two photos were the starting point for writing my first scientific paper, back at the end of 2019. The idea was first to just publish these two new records, which were accompanied by several more from our Italian and Croatian colleagues. We also found one record in Albania supported by a good quality photo on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), which came as a nice surprise. So I prepared something that resembled a manuscript, sent it to my supervisor and ... didn't hear from him for the next 12 months. 

After that time, I got back to the manuscript, searched the web and found a bunch of reports, which included information on sightings of the green sea turtle in the Adriatic Sea. After some discussion, this changed the narrative of the article and we refocused the paper not just on new sightings, but why there seem to be many more sightings since the year 2000, compared to the period before. We now had 8 new, unreported sightings, and roughly 65 reported. This also enabled us to analyse the sizes and temporal distribution of animals that were observed in the Adriatic Sea. For the sake of the publication, the plots were done in a more traditional, standard, black and white (code at the end with all the "polishing details"). My friend Manja drew a very nice sketch of the green turtle head that we added to the empty space of the plot (you can find more of her art [here](https://manjatisler.com/)). For this post, I decided to use a simply `plotly` histogram in which I only changed the color of the bars to match the header of my webpage:    

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

greens <- read.csv("green_length_adr.csv") %>% drop_na(CCL)

# Plotly histogram
greens %>% 
  plotly::plot_ly(data = .,
                  x = ~CCL,
                  type = "histogram",
                  marker = list(color = "#2C3E50")) %>% 
  plotly::layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Curved carapace length (cm)'),
                 yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency'))
```

## What did we figure out in this study?

Based on the data we had acquired and analysed it seems that the number of green sea turtle observations in the Adriatic Sea increased **more than tenfold** between 2000 - 2020, and will likely continue to increase. We attributed this intriguing increase to:

* the increase of the Mediterranean green sea turtle population,
* the increased capacity of institutes, universities and NGOs around the Adriatic, resulting in higher awareness of sea turtles in the region and lastly,
* climate change - warming seas seem to be shifting the Adriatic to be more favourable for green turtles (and they can find many areas with food sources they need).

Two most notable areas where green turtles were most commonly observed were coasts of Albania and southern Italy. Again, there is a more traditional map in the paper, but below you can find the same data visualized using `leaflet`{.r}. You will note that there are two big red circles (recent observations) with the same label in Drini Bay - they simply represent the data divided in two smaller compartments (2003 - 2010 and 2011 - 2018). 

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
library(leaflet)
green_locs <- read.csv("green_locs_adr.csv", sep = ";",
                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

pal <- colorFactor(palette = c("yellow", "orange", "red"),
                   domain = green_locs$Period)

leaflet(green_locs) %>% 
    addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>% 
    addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ X,
                     lat = ~ Y,
                     radius = 4 * sqrt(green_locs$N),
                     stroke = FALSE,
                     fillOpacity = 0.7,
                     color = ~pal(Period),
                     label = green_locs$Location) %>%
    addLegend(pal = pal,
              values = ~Period)


```

We finally managed to publish this article in December 2022. From a relatively easy thing, to publish a couple of new observations of a rare species, this paper turned out to be a quite big review of what we know about green sea turtles in the Adriatic. For me, it was also a steep learning curve on scientific writing. When I look in the folder with my *"version controlled" manuscripts* (there are at least 30), I started as a complete rookie and now feel way better equipped to tackle my three paper PhD dissertation. For those interested in more information about our paper, you can find it and download it [here](https://hrcak.srce.hr/en/clanak/417210).

## Bonus: how did I make and combine the histogram and boxplot for the paper?

I added useful comments to the code bellow that describe what a particular line does. I used `ggplot2`{.r} to create both graphs and polish them mostly within the `theme()`{.r} function. The major adaptations were removing axis labels, titles and ticks, so they are not duplicated. Also, I reduced white space around both plots with `plot.margin =`{.r}. Lastly, I found it most convenient to use the `plot_grid()`{.r} function from `cowplot` package to arrange the two plots according to my preferences.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
library(ggplot2)

# define size classes in 5 cm interval, tickmarks in 10 cm interval and x axis limits
breaks <- seq(20, 80, by = 5)
tick_marks <- seq(20, 80, by = 10)
limits <- c(20, 80)

greens_histogram <-
    ggplot(greens, aes(x = CCL)) +
    geom_histogram(breaks = breaks, color = "black", fill = "white") +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "", # remove axis name
                       limits = limits, # set the x limit, same as for boxplot
                       breaks = tick_marks) + # set the breaks, same as for boxplot
    ylab("Number of records") +
    theme_classic() + # remove a lot of unnecesary noise
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 15, # font size and color of the axis
                                   colour = "black"), # labels (numbers) 
          axis.title = element_text(size = 15), # font size of the axis title
          axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)), # move axis title away from the labels 
          plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm"), 
          # reduce margin around the plot, so there is less white space when adding boxplot
          axis.text.x = element_blank()) # remove labels of x axis, as they will be the same in boxplot 

greens_boxplot <- 
    ggplot(greens, aes(y = CCL)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 5) + # increase the size of outlier points, so they are better visible
    coord_flip() + # flip the boxplot so it is horizontal
    xlab("") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), # removes y axis labels 
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), # removes y axis ticks
          axis.line.y = element_blank(), # removes y axis line
          axis.text = element_text(size = 15, color = "black"), # same as above
          axis.title = element_text(size = 15), # same as above
          axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),  # same as above, only on x axis
          plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm")) + # same as above
    # we are still manipulating y axis, even though we flipped the boxplot
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Curved Carapace Length (cm)", # rename y axis
                       limits = limits, # same as above
                       breaks = tick_marks)  # same as above

library(cowplot)

plot_grid(greens_histogram, # histogram on top
          greens_boxplot, # boxplot below
          ncol = 1, # plots in one column
          align = "v", # vertical alignment
          #axis = "lr", # axis alligned left to right
          rel_heights = c(3, 1), # hist three times bigger than boxplot
          labels = "AUTO", # with automatic labels
          label_size = 15) # of font size 15
```

This last part of the code was not executed in this post, but demonstrates how to add a random image to your plots. If your image is in `.png` use `readPNG()` function to load it into R. Then add it to your plot using `draw_image`{.r} from `cowplot`. You will have to play around with the placement, the numbers in the example below suit our histogram with a lot of blank space top right.   

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(png) # readPNG

artwork <- readPNG("image_you_want_to_insert.png")

greens_histogram +  
    cowplot::draw_image(
        artwork, 
        x = 60, y = 10, # x & y coordinates, where to insert the image
        width = 25, height = 12.5 # size of the image on the plot
        )

```
